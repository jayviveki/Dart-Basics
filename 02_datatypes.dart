  Aim -> Take a look at various data types of dart.

  Data type means type of data that can be represented and manipulated in the
  language.

  There are four main types of data types.
  (Let's put maps and list aside for collections)
  1. int -> hold numeric values without decimal point. (Ex. 12, 45, 50)
  2. double -> hold numeric values with decimal point. (Ex. 12.45, 10.12)
  3. String -> represents sequence of character. (Ex. "Jay", "Sanket")
  4. bool -> represents boolean(flag) values. (Ex. true, false)
*/

main() {
  int salary = 50000;
  double stockPrice = 450.45;
  String name = "Jay";
  bool isValidate = true;

  print(salary);
  print(stockPrice);
  print(name);
  print(isValidate);
}
